# Urban Sounds Classification

The preprocessing phase involved creating spectrograms from audio files using **Librosa** and preprocessing images with **OpenCV**. A **TensorFlow CNN** model was utilized, with hyperparameter optimization applied to achieve over 90% accuracy in classifying urban sounds. The dataset used for this project can be accessed [here]([insert_your_data_link_here](https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html)).

### Certification Achievement

Successfully completed the **Urban Sound Classification** project using CNN, prepared by teammates in **Group 32**. This project was developed for the **Deep Learning Bootcamp** organized by **Global AI Hub**, sponsored by **Ko√ß Holding** and **Aygaz**.
